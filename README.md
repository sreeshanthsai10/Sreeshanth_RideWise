**RideWise: Predicting Bike-Sharing Demand Based on Weather and Urban Events**  

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
RideWise is a predictive web application built using **Streamlit** and a **Machine Learning model** (e.g., Random Forest or Linear Regression).  
Its purpose is to **forecast the hourly demand** for shared bike rentals based on environmental, seasonal, and temporal factors.  

The application allows users to interactively adjust variables like **temperature, weather condition, time of day, and holiday status** to see an immediate prediction of bike rentals.  

---

## ✨ Features  
- **Interactive Input** → Sliders & dropdown menus for conditions (Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, Time, Season).  
- **Real-time Prediction** → Instant forecast of bike rental counts.  
- **Light & Dark Mode UI** → Clean, user-friendly interface with custom CSS.  
- **Deployment Ready** → Structured for deployment on **Streamlit Cloud** or similar platforms.
