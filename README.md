RideWise : Predicting Bike-Sharing Demand Based on Weather and Urban Events 


📌 Project Overview
This project is a predictive web application built using Streamlit and a Machine Learning model (likely a regression model like Random Forest or Linear Regression). Its purpose is to forecast the hourly demand for shared bike rentals based on environmental, seasonal, and temporal factors.

The application allows users to interactively adjust variables like temperature, weather condition, time of day, and holiday status to immediately see an accurate prediction of expected bike rentals.

✨ Features
Interactive Input: Use sliders and dropdown menus to set precise conditions (Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, Time, Season).

Real-time Prediction: Generates an immediate forecast of expected bike rental count upon submission.

Intuitive UI: Custom CSS provides a clean, high-contrast dark-mode interface for ease of use.

Deployment Ready: Structured for easy deployment on platforms like Streamlit Cloud.

📁 Project Structure
The project is organized using a standard data science folder structure:

Bike-app/
├── data/              # Stores final, cleaned datasets used for training/testing.
├── models/            # Stores the trained ML model file (e.g., model.joblib).
├── notebooks/         # Contains EDA and model training/evaluation Jupyter notebooks.
├── src/               # Contains modular Python scripts (if used for modeling/preprocessing).
├── venv/              # Python Virtual Environment (Ignored by Git).
├── .gitignore         # Specifies files/folders Git should ignore.
├── Bikeapp.py         # The main Streamlit application script.
├── README.md          # This file.
└── requirements.txt   # Lists all Python dependencies.
⚙️ Installation and Setup
Follow these steps to get a copy of the project running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
You must have Python 3.8+ installed.

1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the project from GitHub to your local machine:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/sreeshanthsai10/Sreeshanth_RideWise.git
cd Sreeshanth_RideWise
2. Create a Virtual Environment
It's best practice to install dependencies in a virtual environment to avoid conflicts.

Bash

# Create the environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the environment
# On Windows (PowerShell):
.\venv\Scripts\Activate
# On Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
3. Install Dependencies
Install all required Python packages listed in requirements.txt:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the Application
Start the Streamlit application from your terminal:

Bash

streamlit run Bikeapp.py
The application will automatically open in your web browser, typically at http://localhost:8501.
